# Ideas
1. Flowers
   - seed packet pours seed and grows into flower
2. Planets
   - top view of solar system planets moving
   - when date picked or planet clicked zooms down into sun and runs out to planet (stars pass)
   - planet spins in planet view
 3. <b> Music </b>
    - song plays during transition
    - maybe connects to some song recommendations or spotify playlists
    - art during transition to music for music taste
    - scroll through of some album covers

## Music Plan
- HOME: record player with records underneath for each genre, sticky notes with signs
- TRANSITION: when sign clicked or record picked switches to new page which starts with animation of needle being put on record
- SOUND: music for genre begins to play, record spins, image spins out of record to cover background (color for sign and genre)
- FINAL: gives info about why genre goes with sign, link to Spotify playlist (to open in new tab)
