# Decisions
- will always only follow 1 branch
## Conditions and statements
- if {} else{}
    - when if is true it does the if branch, when if is false it does the else branch
    - can use this to see if variable exists by doing something simple such as output true if it exists
- != not equal to
- == is equal to
- !== strict not equal
- === strict equal
- .> greater than
- < less than
- .>= greater or equal
- <= less or equal
---
## Logical Operators
- ((2<5) && (3>=2)) and
- ((2<5) || (3>=2)) or
- (2 < 1) NOT
---
## If/ Else alternatives
- if --> else if --> else if
    - goes through multiple levels and takes first true path
--- 
## Switch Statements
- comparison
- level: 1, 2, 3
- milliseconds faster than if/ else
    - doesnt check ranges just checks for value

# Class Notes
- Forms
    - mainly run with php etc.
    - can use java to set up form
    - ay input should be inside of form to pass validation

    - javascript uses ID
    - service side scripts uses name (PHP)
    - good practice to use same name for both
- button
    - add onlick and link to java function
- check fuction before adding code to make sure it is being called
    - console.log ('computeZod called')
- to get answer to show up on page
    - create a div with some text
    - create variable calling that ID
    - create variable in function calling global variable
    - .innerHTML = 'what you want'
- BRACKETS MULTI LINE SELECT: HOLD DOWN ALT AND SELECT DOWN LINES THEN SELECT OVER AS FAR AS YOU WANT IN EACH LINE
    - ctrl D to duplicate line in brackets
- can combine arrays into objects
- to select specific poart of string
    - variable.substr(where to start, how many positions)
- how to convert strings to numbers: parsInt
- window.alert --> tell user invalid input instead of returning error
